# NASA-TLX LaTeX Version

This repository contains the source for a [NASA-TLX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA-TLX) version developed using [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX). This repository is based on the information of [Hart and Stavelandâ€™s NASA Task Load Index (TLX)](https://humansystems.arc.nasa.gov/groups/TLX/downloads/TLXScale.pdf) sample. The  method assesses work load on five 7-point scales. Increments of high, medium and low estimates for each point result in 21 gradations on the scales. The general template can be found on the [`src/`](src/) directory, while the *samples* can be found at [`samples/`](samples/) directory. We used the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) format, a typesetting system that includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is available as [free software](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/).
